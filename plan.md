Developing an Education Management System (EMS) for schools and educational institutions in Nigeria is a substantial project. Here's a high-level plan to guide through the process:

**1. Define Objectives and Scope:**
   - Clearly define the goals and objectives of the EMS.
   - Identify the specific features and functionalities you want to include, such as student record management, grade tracking, parent communication, etc.
   - Determine the target audience (e.g., primary schools, secondary schools, universities).

**2. Market Research:**
   - Conduct thorough market research to understand the needs and competition in the Nigerian education management software market.
   - Identify any legal or regulatory requirements specific to Nigeria's educational system.

**3. Design and Architecture:**
   - Create a system architecture that outlines how different components of the EMS will interact.
   - Develop wireframes and prototypes to visualize the user interface.
   - Plan for scalability, security, and data privacy.

**4. Technology Stack:**
   - Choose appropriate technologies and programming languages for development.
   - Consider cloud hosting options for scalability and accessibility.
   
**5. Development:**
   - Build the core functionalities of the EMS, including user authentication, student database, grade tracking, and communication modules.
   - Implement data storage solutions, ensuring data security and compliance with regulations.
   - Develop a user-friendly dashboard for administrators, teachers, parents, and students.
   
**6. Testing:**
   - Conduct thorough testing, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing.
   - Identify and fix any bugs or issues.
   
**7. Security and Compliance:**
   - Implement strong security measures to protect sensitive student data.
   - Ensure compliance with data protection laws in Nigeria.
   
**8. Deployment:**
   - Deploy the EMS on a reliable hosting environment.
   - Provide training to school staff and administrators on how to use the system.
   
**9. User Support and Maintenance:**
   - Establish a customer support system for addressing user issues and inquiries.
   - Regularly update and maintain the system to fix bugs and introduce new features.
   
**10. Marketing and Adoption:**
    - Develop a marketing strategy to promote the EMS to educational institutions in Nigeria.
    - Consider offering pilot programs or incentives to encourage adoption.

**11. Feedback and Improvement:**
    - Collect feedback from users to identify areas for improvement.
    - Continuously update and enhance the EMS based on user input and changing educational needs.

**12. Data Backup and Recovery:**
    - Implement a robust data backup and recovery plan to safeguard against data loss.

**13. Monitoring and Reporting:**
    - Create tools for monitoring system performance and generating reports for school administrators.

**14. Integration:**
    - Explore opportunities for integration with other educational software or services, such as learning management systems (LMS) or admission management systems.

**15. Sustainability and Future Planning:**
    - Develop a long-term sustainability plan, including revenue generation models (e.g., subscription fees).
    - Stay updated with changes in education technology trends and regulations in Nigeria to adapt the system accordingly.

Remember that building an EMS is a complex project, and it's crucial to involve education experts, software developers, and legal advisors to ensure its success and compliance with local regulations.
